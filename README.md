# âš¡ Guide: How to setup LND with PostgreSQL


## ðŸ“„ Prelude and Objective

A short guide on how to setup and configure a **_new_** lightning node using LND with recently released PostgreSQL support as database backend. The  approach was done by creating a new lightning node. To date, backend data migrations are still being developed. A brief write-up for PostgreSQL support was released by Lightning Labs here: [postgres.md](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/master/docs/postgres.md). Nevertheless it lacks important parts which this guide wants to cover step by step.

## ðŸ”Ž Preconditions

The guide is based on the following setup and components. It may be different for Umbrel / Raspiblitz / MyNode installations as it was established on a bolt / bare metal setup running Ubuntu.

- OS: Ubuntu 22.04
- Setup: bare metal / [bolt setup](https://raspibolt.org/)
- Lightning Implementation: [lnd-0.14.3-beta](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/releases/tag/v0.14.3-beta)
- Database Backend: PostgreSQL 14.2 (latest version in ubuntu's repository)
- **node state: new node without funds and channels (âš )**

It's important to emphasize that this setup is built as a new lightning node without existing funds or channels. As said, data migrations between different backends (bbolt, postgres, etcd) are not yet supported (as of v0.14.3).

## ðŸ›  Install and setup PostgreSQL

Installation process of LND is omitted in this guide as this is widely described on the internet. So I assume a valid installation here and continue to setup the backend:

```sh
# Install postgresql-14 

$ sudo apt install postgresql-14 postgresql-server-dev-14

# Configure postgresql to your needs (port, datadir, logging, etc.) or use default values.

$ sudo nano /etc/postgresql/14/main/postgresql.conf

# Setup postgres user

$ sudo -i -u postgres
$ psql

postgres=# \password

# Enter password and take note of it!

# Quit PSQL
\q

```

Create user and database for LND:

```sh
# As postgres user

$ sudo -i -u postgres

# Create user 'lnd' and set a password
$ createuser --createdb --pwprompt lnd

# Enter password and take note of it!

# Create database 'lndb' 
$ createdb -O lnd lndb

# Exit user postgres
$ exit
```

## ðŸ›  Configure LND

Configure your `lnd.conf`:

```sh
$ sudo nano /home/lnd/.lnd/lnd.conf
```

Edit and add your postgresql config and credentials, like so: `postgresql://<user>:<pw>@<ip>:<port>/<db>`

```ini
[db]
db.backend=postgres
db.postgres.dsn=postgresql://lnd:password@127.0.0.1:5432/lndb
db.postgres.timeout=0
```

Add postgres as a requirement to LND's systemd service:
```sh
[Unit]
Description=...
Requires=postgresql@.service bitcoind.service
After=postgresql@.service bitcoind.service
```

If everything went fine, you can see this in the `lnd.log`:
```
[INF] LTND: Opening the main database, this might take a few minutes...
[INF] LTND: Using remote postgres database! Creating graph and channel state DB instances
```

## â™» Upgrade PostgreSQL
  
Upgrading PostgreSQL should be easy using Postgres' own tool `pg_upgrade`. Install and setup next version in parallel. Upgrade to new datadir, dry-run before doing the command (`--check` = dry-run) from v13 to v14:

```
/usr/lib/postgresql/14/bin/pg_upgrade \
  --old-datadir=/var/lib/postgresql/13/main \
  --new-datadir=/var/lib/postgresql/14/main \
  --old-bindir=/usr/lib/postgresql/13/bin \
  --new-bindir=/usr/lib/postgresql/14/bin \
  --old-options '-c config_file=/etc/postgresql/13/main/postgresql.conf' \
  --new-options '-c config_file=/etc/postgresql/14/main/postgresql.conf' \
  --check
```
